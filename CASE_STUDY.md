## Case Study

[As a contributor](https://benapatton.com) I believe it is important to understand the position the author has taken above from someone who has been in the midst of this frontend world. I know the initial reaction, as someone who mostly been a 'junior developer' do to frameworks, is to think, "is it really that big of a deal?"

So without saying yes or no and leaving it there, we can walk down memory lane. 

In 2020 I was learning to code. In the Summer of 2020 I had reached a place in my learning where I needed help. I needed instructor guidance. The promise of coding bootcamps is and remains wonderful. To help someone turn their life around, change their life, etc within a short period of time by learning to code and getting a job as a software engineer. 

So after much discussion and discernment, off to coding bootcamp I went. 

### Condensced Learning Affects Decision Making

To be clear, I am grateful to my instructor for teaching me. I don't ever want to give the impression of a lack of gratitude to those who have helped me start on a different career path in life. 

One of the things you find as you look at code school curriculum is what the emphasis is on. Much like the saying, "show me your check book and I'll show you where your priorities are," we get the same from a curriculum/syllabus.

In many bootcamps, you spend a minimal amount of time on HTML and CSS. In our case, this was 2 weeks or so. The next 8 weeks were learning JavaScript. We were going down the "full-stack" path so we were learning Nodejs for Backend development. We spent bout 4 of those 8 weeks on JavaScript and Nodejs/Databases and then the rest of the time was learning React. 

Fast forward a few months and I had my first developer job ðŸŽ‰

### Blinded By React

I hate to admit this but early on I was incredibly arrogant. I went to work at a contracting company using JQuery, C#, .NET, and every day _"was a terrible day because life would be so much better if we could use React."_ 

But _why_ was this the thought process? Why is this what many have come to truly believe about web development? There is a great statement by Ryan Florence called, "The Curse of React." It is too long to quote in detail but as someone who has built a business on React and it's short comings/filling in it's gaps and now is a founder a "React Framework" built on Web Standards, he has been immersed in React for a very long time.

The essence of "The Curse of React" is that React made creating UI so simple that no one questioned what issues came with it like performance, accessibility, and others. 

So most people know what they can do with React and neglect what they don't know thus, as the Author of this document has made clear, they remain a junior for a long period of time. 

### How React Hurts Your Team

"Author code that will run forever all you have to do is add features." I guarantee every person who reads this either thinks, "That sounds incredible!" or "Dang, wouldn't that be nice ðŸ˜”" 

Why? Because the state of React is once you have opted in to React, you have to keep up. Why? Because React changes so often, learning materials and 'best practices' change so often. So if you are going to do 'quality' engineering work, and keep up with 'best practices', you will have to _rewrite_ your React code. 

Hiring Manager, ask your Engineer lead, if your company does use React, "How often does a developer mention updating code, upgrading to a new version of React or Nextjs, or think we need to 'refactor' our application?"

If the answer is more than 0, that is why this is a problem. And it will happen with a React application at any scale. Why? Because the React ecosystem's greatest benefit is it's greatest struggle. A community that has built packages upon packages for React applications that are being used in production have to keep up with React's changing api's. So even if your company doesn't think they need to upgrade, if any packages that are built on React that you use upgrade, you have to keep up with them now as well. A community of breaking changes. 

React may be utterly fun for developers. But for companies having code that lasts and not hiring more developers to simply maintain what has been written has, I'm afraid, become a pipe dream.
