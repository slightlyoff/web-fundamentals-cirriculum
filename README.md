# A Suggested Cirriculum for Web Frontend Fundamentals

## Why This Document?

The state of today's discourse around frontend web technologies is not in a good place. Many managers assume that they must adopt React (or similarly heavy and slow) tools because _"that's what we can hire for"_. Students are simultaneously told that they need to learn technologies developed for the web as it was more than 15 years ago _"because that's what employers want"_. These narratives elide the primary role of professional frontend work: to serve users and the organisastions that serve them.

We reject these narratives, and assert that students and businesses are best served when they focus on web platform fundamentals. These fundamentals provide a lifetime of value to those who learn them and drive success for the products and services based in them.
