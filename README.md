# A Suggested Curriculum for Web Frontend Fundamentals

## Why This Document?

The state of today's discourse around frontend web technologies is not in a good place. Many managers assume that they must adopt React (or similarly heavy and slow) tools because _"that's what we can hire for"_. Students are simultaneously told that they need to learn legacy frameworks _"because that's what employers want"_. These narratives elide the primary role of professional frontend work: to serve users and the organisastions that serve them. They also underplay the power of the web platform, and how advanced widely deployed browsers have become.

We reject these narratives, and assert that students and businesses are best served when they focus on web platform fundamentals. These fundamentals provide a lifetime of value to those who learn them and drive success for the products and services based in them.

### Essentials

Building for the web is to be building for/on Browsers. It is common for Browsers to be an after thought or taken for granted when learning frontend fundamentals. Having a strong intuition for how Browsers work will build bridges for developers, new and seasoned, to reach new heights in their career.

 - Browser DevTools; vary by browser, but all provide similarly powerful inspection capabilities.

### HTML Structure

To build for the web is to author HTML. It is not uncommon to hear seasoned developers who look into HTML again to say something like, "I didn't know this existed." HTML has incredible capabilities and much of the things we build to "work around HTML" are unnecessary.

### CSS

To build for the web is to work with CSS. Beautiful design and web pages rely on CSS and not enough developers are aware of it's capabilities. The teaching and instruction in the industry around CSS has gotten really good in the past few years. Features are being added to CSS frequently that therefore allow for further leaning into it's capabilities as a standard.

### JavaScript & Interactivity

Interactivity is probably the trickiest concept to grasp. At face value it is very simple. However, JavaScript is meant to _"add"_ interactivity to the site _NOT_ be the thing applications are dependent upon.
